# Sales-Analysis-Report-Using-MySQL-and-PowerBI

## Problem Statement:

The sales head of a national-level company is having issues getting insights into the sales that are happening across the country. Sales for his company are declining every year, and he is worried about it. Whenever he asks for reports from regional managers, they send him lots of Excel files, and he is not able to draw any conclusions from those files. All of the company data gets stored on a MySQL server, and he is looking to get an automated dashboard from that data, which he can see at any moment and anywhere to get sales insights.

In this project, I first uploaded the data to the MySQL workbench and ran some queries to get insights from it. I have created a stored procedure to get the data for the particular market and have also created a view to show my skills in MySQL. After this, I created the data model in Power BI and then cleaned the data using a Power query. I have used this clean data to build a dashboard using Power BI reports.

### Attached Files:

* MySQL Database File: Link for MySQL Database File, which I used to create a database on MySQL Workbench.

* MySQL Queries File: This File contains all the queries that I have used to get insights using the SQL language.

* Dashboard Link : This is the link to the Power BI Dashboard, which I built using the dataset. 

### Data Overview:-

This sales MySQL database consists of five tables:- 

<ol>
<li>Transaction</li>
<li>Products</li>
<li>Customers</li>
<li>Markets</li>
<li>Date</li>  
</ol>
